#ref ISLE bibtex database

The primary purpose of this repo is to publish two bibtex databases:

* isle_pubs.bib - publications of the Illinois Speech and Language Engineering group
* references.bib - papers that have been cited in ISLE papers, courses, seminars

Other documents contained here:

* pdfs - pdfs of a few papers that might be hard to find otherwise
* testreferences.py - test a bibtex file to make sure it parses, and its URLs and DOIs resolve
