#ref My bibtex database

This repo is just a place to store my personal bibtex file.
This file contains, more or less, every article I've ever read and
found worth reading, and a few that I haven't read. 

To test if all of the references can be read:

    git clone https://github.com/jhasegaw/ref
    cd ref
    pip install bibtexparser
    python ./testreferences.py

Currently returns:

    Successfully read 3752 bibtex entries from references.bib
